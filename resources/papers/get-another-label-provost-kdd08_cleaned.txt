ABSTRACTThis paper addresses the repeated acquisition of labels for dataitems when the labeling is imperfect. We examine the improve-ment (or lack thereof) in data quality via repeated labeling,and focus especially on the improvement of training labelsfor supervised induction. With the outsourcing of small tasksbecoming easier, for example via Rent-A-Coder or Amazon’sMechanical Turk, it often is possible to obtain less-than-expertlabeling at low cost. With low-cost labeling, preparing theunlabeled part of the data can become considerably moreexpensive than labeling. We present repeated-labeling strate-gies of increasing complexity, and show several main results.(i) Repeated-labeling can improve label quality and modelquality, but not always. (ii) When labels are noisy, repeatedlabeling can be preferable to single labeling even in the tradi-tional setting where labels are not particularly cheap. (iii) Assoon as the cost of processing the unlabeled data is not free,even the simple strategy of labeling everything multiple timescan give considerable advantage. (iv) Repeatedly labeling acarefully chosen set of points is generally preferable, and wepresent a robust technique that combines different notionsof uncertainty to select data points for which quality shouldbe improved. The bottom line: the results show clearly thatwhen labeling is not perfect, selective acquisition of multiplelabels is a strategy that data miners should have in theirrepertoire; for certain label-quality/cost regimes, the benefitis substantial.Categories and Subject DescriptorsH.2.8 [Database Applications]: Data mining; I.5.2 [DesignMethodology]: Classifier design and evaluationGeneral TermsAlgorithms, Design, Experimentation, Management, Measure-ment, PerformanceKeywordsdata selection, data preprocessingPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work forpersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies arenot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copiesbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.
