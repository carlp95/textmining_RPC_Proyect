Abstract-Based on in-depth study of the existing data mining and association rule mining algorithms, a new mining algorithm of weighted association rules is proposed. By introducing a support factor of the weighted frequent item sets, a reasonable minimum support is set. The algorithm does not need to repeatedly scan the database in the discovery of frequent item sets, so it greatly reduces the time of input and output, and improves the efficiency of data mining.
