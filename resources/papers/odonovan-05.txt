Abstract
To be successful recommender systems must gain
the trust of users. To do this they must demonstrate
their ability to make reliable predictions. We ar-
gue that collaborative filtering recommendation al-
gorithms can benefit from explicit models of trust
to inform their predictions. We present one such
model of trust along with a cost-benefit analysis
that focuses on the classical trade-off that exists be-
tween recommendation coverage and prediction ac-
curacy.
1 Introduction
Recommender systems have been developed as a solu-
tion to the well documented information overload problem.
[Resnick et al., 1994], [Breese et al., 1998]. These systems
employ techniques from user profiling, machine learning and
information filtering to produce individual recommendations
of items to suit users’ requirements. Collaborative filtering
(CF) recommenders operate on the assumption that similar
users share similar tastes; recommendations are generated for
a target user by analysing the rating histories of a set of suit-
able recommendation partners.
The traditional CF approach relies heavily on the similar-
ity between the target user and its partner as a way to weight
each partner’s predictions [Resnick et al., 1994]. In this pa-
per we propose that, in addition, it is possible to model the
trustworthiness of these partners, and to use this as another
factor to influence their prediction contributions. Indeed the
idea of explicitly modeling and using trust in filtering tasks is
becoming increasingly popular. For example, [Golbeck and
Hendler, 2004] presents a trust-based email filter, trust scores
in this system are calculated through inference and propaga-
tion, of the form (A ⇒ B ⇒ C) ⇒ (A ⇒ C), where A,
B and C are users with interpersonal trust scores. The Trust-
Mail application [Golbeck and Hendler, 2004] looks up an
email sender in the reputation/trust network, and provides an
inline rating for each mail. These trust values can tell a user
if a mail is important or unimportant. Trust values in this sys-
tem can be defined with respect to a certain topic, or on a
general level, in a similar manner to work in [O’Donovan and
Smyth, 2005a] and [O’Donovan and Smyth, 2005b].
[Avesani et al., 2004] describe a trust-based recommender
system in the skiing domain. However these approaches rely
on models of trust that are built from the direct feedback of
users; in short, individual users are expected to indicate those
partners that they place the most trust in and a trust model is
generated from the resulting graph of relationships.
[Massa and Bhattacharjee, 2004] build a trust model di-
rectly from explicit user-provided trust ratings. This work
is carried out using the popular epinions.com service. Epin-
ions.com is a web site that allows users to review various
items (cars, books, music, etc.). In addition they can assign
a trust rating to reviewers based on the degree to which they
have found them to be helpful and reliable in the past. [Massa
and Bhattacharjee, 2004] argue that this trust data can be ex-
tracted and used as part of the recommendation process, espe-
cially as a means to relieve the sparsity problem (lack of over-
lapping user ratings) that has hampered traditional collabora-
tive filtering techniques7 [O’Sullivan et al., 2002]. [Massa
and Bhattacharjee, 2004] argue that it is possible to compare
users according to their degree of connectedness in the trust-
graph encoded by Epinions.com, but do not show that this
method of comparison maintains recommendation accuracy.
Our benchmark algorithm uses Resnick’s standard predic-
tion formula which is reproduced below as Equation 1; see
also [Resnick et al., 1994]. In this formula c(i) is the rating
to be predicted for item i in consumer profile c and p(i) is
the rating for item i by a producer profile p who has rated
i. In addition, c and p refers to the mean ratings for c and p
respectively. The weighting factor sim(c, p) is a measure of
the similarity between profiles c and p, which is traditionally
calculated as Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
c(i) = c +
∑
pP (i)
(p(i)− p)sim(c, p)
∑
pPi
|sim(c, p)|
(1)
As we have seen above Resnick’s prediction formula dis-
counts the contribution of a partner’s prediction according to
its degree of similarity with the target user so that more simi-
lar partners have a large impact on the final ratings prediction.
We argue that there is another factor which might be used
in conjunction with similarity to influence recommendation
and prediction. We believe that the reliability of a partner pro-
file to deliver accurate recommendations in the past is another
important factor, one that we refer to as the trust. Intuitively,
if a profile has made lots of accurate recommendation predic-
tions in the past they can be viewed as more trustworthy than
another profile that has made many poor predictions. We de-
scribe a computational model of trust that can be generated
unobtrusively, during the normal operation of a CF recom-
mender system, by mining the recommendation histories of
different recommendation partners. We re-evaluate work in
[O’Donovan and Smyth, 2005b] which shows that trust-based
methods can improve prediction accuracy when compared to
existing CF approaches. However, we describe a more com-
prehensive cost-benefit analysis by considering three accu-
racy benefits against changes in recommendation coverage.
2 A Computational Model of Trust
Intuitively, if a recommendation partner (profile) has made
many good predictions in the past, it can be viewed as more
trustworthy than one with many poor predictions. The trust
model [O’Donovan and Smyth, 2005b] is based on this idea.
We differentiate between profiles generating recommenda-
tions (producer profiles) and those receiving recommenda-
tions (consumer profiles) in a particular recommendation ses-
sion. To generate a predicted rating, p(i), for item i for some
consumer c, conventional CF systems draw on the services
of a number of producer profiles, combining their individual
recommendations according to some suitable function, such
as Resnick’s formula. (see Equation 1). Our trust model de-
pends on whether these predicted ratings are correct relative
to the true ratings of the consumer, c(i); see Equation 2.
Correct(i, p, c) ⇔ |p(i)− c(i)| <  (2)
2.1 Item-Level Trust
We define the item-level trust for each producer p with respect
to a given profile item i to be the percentage of times that p
has made a correct rating prediction for i across some set
of consumers; see Equation 3. To do this we consider the
rating that p alone predicts for i for the consumer in question.
We define the RecSet(p) (Equation 4) to be the total set of
rating predictions that p has made; each (rk, ik) refers to a
rating prediction, rk that p has made for item ik. Similarly,
CorrSet(p) is the subset of these ratings that are considered
to be correct; Equation 5.
TrustI(p, i) =
|{(rk, ik) ∈ CorrSet(p) : ik = i}|
|{(rk, ik) ∈ RecSet(p) : ik = i}|
(3)
RecSet(p) = {(r1, i1), ..., (rn, in)} (4)
CorrSet(p) = {(ck, ik) ∈ RecSet(p) : Correct(ik, p, ck)}
(5)
Thus, the trust of p in relation to item i is a measure of how
often p’s predicted ratings for i have been considered correct
in the past. This information can be accumulated during the
normal course of operation of a CF recommender system in
a variety of ways. For example, users could be asked their
Figure 1: Recommendation Error.
opinions of the predicted ratings, or this might be confirmed
by evaluating the user’s actions on the basis of the rating pre-
dictions; if a user buys a highly rated item then we might
assume that the high rating was justified.
2.2 Trust-Based Recommendation
We incorporate our trust-model into CF by modifying the
standard Resnick prediction algorithm in 3 ways to produce
3 different trust-based variations. Resnick’s standard predic-
tion formula is given in Equation 1. Normally it uses the
similarity between the target user profile and each recommen-
dation partner profile to weight their prediction contributions,
shown as sim(c, p) in Equation 1; Equation 6 shows our mod-
ifications to this standard equation by adding the w(c, p, i)
weighting term. Our first variation (WItem) modifies this so
that the weighting term is a combination of item trust and pro-
file similarity; we use the harmonic mean of trust and similar-
ity. The FItem approach differs in that it uses profile similar-
ity as the weight factor, but filters out profiles that fall below a
given trust level for the target item prior to recommendation.
Finally, the CItem approach uses the obvious combination of
WItem and FItem.
r(i) = r +
∑
pP (i)
(p(i)− p)w(c, p, i)
∑
pP (i)
|w(c, p, i)|

3 Evaluation
For the following evaluation we use the 943 profiles from the
MovieLens data-set, split into 80% as training profiles and
the remaining 20% as test profiles. During training we use
a leave-one-out approach to build our trust model over the
training profiles. Briefly, each training profile is used as a
consumer with the remaining acting as producers and item-
level trust values are computed on the basis of the correctness
or otherwise of the producer predictions. During testing, we
evaluate the predictions of the training profiles for each of
the items in the test profiles and using our 4 basic algorithms
(Resnick, WItem, FItem, CItem).
In this evaluation we are especially interested in the trade-
off between the coverage of a recommender (the percentage
of items that a rating can be predicted for) (Figure 2) and
Figure 2: Recommendation Coverage.
the error over these predictions (Figure 1). The error graph
shows a positive response to error for the trust-based meth-
ods, especially those that employ trust-based filtering and in
particular for the higher trust-levels. For example, at a trust
level of 0.9 only those profiles that have previously been cor-
rect 90% or more of the time that they have been called upon
to rate an item, are included as recommendation partners for
the filter-based approaches (FItem and CItem). And for these
approaches we see significant error reductions of up to 57%
compared to the baseline Resnick. However, the coverage re-
sults indicate that these error reductions come at a cost. In
particular, the minimal error rates at the highest trust thresh-
olds reduce coverage by over 90%, which is unlikely to be
acceptable in most recommendation scenarios. However, for
trust thresholds below 0.5 we get significant error reductions
while preserving coverage to a reasonable degree. In partic-
ular, the error for CItem is seen to drop most rapidly up to a
trust threshold of 0.2, at which point it offers 85% coverage
and an error of 0.71; Resnick’s error is 22% higher than this.
4 CONCLUSIONS
We believe that computational models of trust can improve
the effectiveness of recommender systems. We have shown
that by integrating an item-level model of trust into standard
collaborative filtering we can increase accuracy by up to 57%
by using only the top 1% most trustworthy profiles as recom-
mendation partners. While this benefit comes at a significant
coverage cost, more reasonable coverage can be achieved
with reduced error rates by less drastic filtering thresholds.
In addition to improving prediction accuracy, we believe that
this trust-based approach may make recommenders more ro-
bust to attack by malicious users, as discussed in [O’Mahony
et al., 2002], [Levien, 2003] and [Kushmerick, 2002]. This is
a matter that we will investigate as part of future work.
