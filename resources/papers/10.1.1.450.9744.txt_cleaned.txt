Abstract Data warehouses provide a great deal of opportu- nities for performing data mining tasks such as classification and clustering. Typically, updates are collected and applied to the data warehouse pe- riodically in a batch mode, e.g., during the night. Then, all patterns derived from the warehouse by some data mining algorithm have to be updated as well. Due to the very large size of the databases, itis highly desirable to perform these updates incre- mentally. In this paper, we present the first incre- mental clustering algorithm. Our algorithm is based on the clustering algorithmDBSCAN which is applicable to any database containing data from a metric space, e.g., to a spatial database or to a WWW-log database. Due to the density-based na- ture of DBSCAN, the insertion or deletion of an object affects the current clustering only in the neighborhood of this object. Thus, efficient algo-
