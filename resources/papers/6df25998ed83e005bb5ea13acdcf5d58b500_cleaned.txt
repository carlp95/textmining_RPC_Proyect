AbstractPartitioning a large set of objects into homogeneous clusters is afundamental operation in data mining. The k-means algorithm isbest suited for implementing this operation because of itsefficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only onnumeric values limits its use in data mining because data sets indata mining often contain categorical values. In this paper wepresent an algorithm, called k-modes, to extend the k-meansparadigm to categorical domains. We introduce new dissimilaritymeasures to deal with categorical objects, replace means ofclusters with modes, and use a frequency based method to updatemodes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering costfunction. Tested with the well known soybean disease data setthe algorithm has demonstrated a very good classificationperformance. Experiments on a very large health insurance dataset consisting of half a million records and 34 categoricalattributes show that the algorithm is scalable in terms of both thenumber of clusters and the number of records.
