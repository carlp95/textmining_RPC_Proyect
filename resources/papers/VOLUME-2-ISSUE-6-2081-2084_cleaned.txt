Abstract— Association rule mining is the most important technique in the field of data mining. Association rule mining finding frequent patterns, associations, correlations, or causal structures among sets of items or objects in transaction databases, relational databases, and other information repositories. In this paper we present a survey of recent research work carried by different researchers. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all the research work, yet we hope that it will provide a guideline for the researcher in interesting research directions that have yet to be explored.   Keywords— Association Rules, Confidence, frequent items,  Item set, Minimum Support. .
