AbstractTo be successful recommender systems must gainthe trust of users. To do this they must demonstratetheir ability to make reliable predictions. We ar-gue that collaborative filtering recommendation al-gorithms can benefit from explicit models of trustto inform their predictions. We present one suchmodel of trust along with a cost-benefit analysisthat focuses on the classical trade-off that exists be-tween recommendation coverage and prediction ac-curacy.
