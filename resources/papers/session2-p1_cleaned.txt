Abstract. In this paper, we provide the preliminaries of basic concepts about association rule mining and survey the list of existing association rule mining techniques. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all the al-gorithms, yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions that have yet to be explored.
