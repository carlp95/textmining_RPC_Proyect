AbstractWe examine the learning-curve sampling method, an approach for applying machine-learning algorithms to large data sets. The approach is based on the observation thatthe computational cost of learning a model increases as a function of the sample size of thetraining data, whereas the accuracy of a model has diminishing improvements as a functionof sample size. Thus, the learning-curve sampling method monitors the increasing costsand performance as larger and larger amounts of data are used for training, and termi-nates learning when future costs outweigh future benefits. In this paper, we formalize the
