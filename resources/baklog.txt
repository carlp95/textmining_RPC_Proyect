 Decision tree is an important method for both induction research and data mining, which is mainly used for model classification and prediction. ID3 algorithm is the most widely used algorithm in the decision tree so far. In this paper,the shortcoming of ID3's inclining to choose attributes with many values is discussed, and then a new decision tree algorithm which is improved version of ID3. In our proposed algorithm attributes are divided into groups and then we apply the selection measure 5 for these groups. If information gain is not good then again divide attributes values into groups. These teps are done until we get good classification/misclassification ratio. The proposed algorithms classify the data sets more accurately and efficiently. Index Terms—Classification, decision tree, knowledge engineering, data mining, supervised learning.===== Modelo Cargado: resources/dataset_model.dat =====

 Abstract Data warehouses provide a great deal of opportu- nities for performing data mining tasks such as classification and clustering. Typically, updates are collected and applied to the data warehouse pe- riodically in a batch mode, e.g., during the night. Then, all patterns derived from the warehouse by some data mining algorithm have to be updated as well. Due to the very large size of the databases, itis highly desirable to perform these updates incre- mentally. In this paper, we present the first incre- mental clustering algorithm. Our algorithm is based on the clustering algorithmDBSCAN which is applicable to any database containing data from a metric space, e.g., to a spatial database or to a WWW-log database. Due to the density-based na- ture of DBSCAN, the insertion or deletion of an object affects the current clustering only in the neighborhood of this object. Thus, efficient algo- rithms can be given for incremental insertions and deletions to an existing clustering. Based on the formal definition of clusters, it can be proven that the incremental algorithm yields the same result as DBSCAN. A performance evaluation of Incre- mentalDBSCAN on a spatial database as well as on a WWW-log database is presented, demonstrat- ing the efficiency of theproposed algorithm. Incre- mentalDBSCAN yields significant speed-up factors over DBSCAN even for large numbers of daily updates in a data warehouse. ===== Modelo Cargado: resources/dataset_model.dat =====
